## Implementing a RAG system in Elixir

I'm working on a project to render a data visualization graph of my family. This project will be part of this blog and
it will have the classical drawer where people can ask questions about me or my relatives.

It goes without saying that Python is the default language when it comes to data science and ML. However, I wanted to implement LLM-related
things using the Elixir language. This blog post explores my journey while doing so, as well as the challenges I faced.

---

As a recap, these are the steps required in a RAG system:

- Define the knowledge base format.
- Split the content in chunks.
- Define an embedding model.
- Define a vector database to use.
- Define a chat model.

## Defining the knowledge base format

Originally I thought about using markdown to organize the information. Each markdown file would be a consolidated file for each person of my family.
However, I decided to use JSON because Markdown is more limited in terms of metadata and structured information. Since I know the structure and initially I'm the one who'll produce all the content, JSON felt right.

## Splitting content into chunks

The whole idea of using RAG is that you can grab some content, insert it into a vector database, and query that later using natural language. There will be a mechanism that will find the closely related context in your vector database, based on your input.

When we think about chunking, we have a few options:

- Using a naive text splitter
- Using a library that splits the text for you
- Another alternative

Usually, you define a few parameters for chunking

- length: Defines the length of each chunk length
- overlap: Defines how many characters will overlap between each chunk

A proper chunking is not about randomly splitting strings. You want chunks to have the most relevant context together so that when you query certain information, the appropriate context will come back and then you can use it to respond to questions about it.

With that in mind, we immediately reject the first naive split option.

Second, one can find libraries with more innovative mechanisms to split the content semantically. In Elixir, I saw two libraries

- [Chunx](https://github.com/preciz/chunx). At the time of writing this post, it had been eight months without any changes, so it gives me the impression
that it's not actively maintained.
- [Text Chunker](https://github.com/revelrylabs/text_chunker_ex). Has more options and looks like a good choice based on the features it has.

Finally, after chatting with my friend Yugo Sakamoto, he suggested that every chunk in my app could also be an _stringified_ JSON map. A JSON map in my application represents a person with information
about their biography as well as hobbies, birth date, and relationships with other members of the family. So that fits.

## Defining an embedding model

I chose `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` as an embedding model for several reasons:

- **Size**: At 80MB, it's lightweight enough for local development and testing
- **Performance**: Despite its small size, it captures semantic information effectively
- **Dimensions**: Produces 384-dimensional vectors, which are manageable for in-memory storage
- **Community adoption**: Well-tested and widely used in the community

In this step, the input is the text chunks and the output will be 384-dimensional vectors.

## Defining a vector database

I decided to go for an in-memory vector database to get to an MVP point faster.

The trade-offs of this approach:

**Pros:**
- No external dependencies or setup required
- Fast retrieval for small to medium datasets
- Perfect for prototyping and MVP development

**Cons:**
- Data doesn't persist between application restarts
- Limited scalability compared to dedicated vector databases like Pinecone or Weaviate
- All vectors must fit in memory

I implemented a cosine similarity in Elixir using Nx tensors, which provides efficient vector operations similar to NumPy in Python.

## Selecting the chat model

Finally, we need a chat model to feed the top-K best results from the similarity search. The idea is that a GPT-like model grabs that information and extracts the proper information based on the user's question.

I chose `google/gemma-2b` for several reasons:

- **Size**: At 2B parameters, it's small enough to run locally on most machines
- **Performance**: Provides good text generation quality for its size
- **Licensing**: Permissive license allows for commercial use
- **Bumblebee Support**: Well-supported in the Elixir ecosystem through Bumblebee since it's available via Hugging Faces

For example:

The following snippet describes the vector search looks output. I was interested in the top 3 results

```
1. (Score: 0.138) {"bio":"Person A bio.","birth_date":"1980-01-15" ...}
--------------------------------------------------
2. (Score: 0.127) {"bio":"Person B bio.","birth_date":"1985-11-10" ...}
--------------------------------------------------
3. (Score: 0.106) {"bio":"Person C bio.","birth_date":"1950-03-09" ...}
```

When we feed this information to the chat model, a model like `GPT-4` or in my case `google/gemma-2b` will be able to extract the relevant information and answer your question using natural language.
When somebody asks "Tell me about person A", the model will respond something like:

```
Person A is a software engineer. He is married to Jane Doe and has two children, Alice and Bob. He lives in San Francisco
```

## Implementation

The implementation combines several Elixir libraries to create a functional RAG system:

### Key Components

**JSON Processing**: Using Jason for parsing family member data and converting it into searchable chunks.

**Nx and Bumblebee**: Used for loading and running the embedding model locally. Bumblebee provides a high-level API for transformer models, while Nx handles the tensor operations.

**GenServer and Supervisor**: The RAG system runs as a GenServer process, maintaining the vector database in memory and handling concurrent queries efficiently, while keeping the system fault-tolerant. Also,
I added a specific RAG supervisor to handle failures gracefully.

### Basic Pipeline

```Elixir
# Simplified flow
  query -> embed_query -> similarity_search -> top_k_results -> chat_model -> response
```

### Challenges Faced

1. **Model Loading**: Initial model loading time can be significant. Using a GenServer allows for lazy loading and model caching. Moreover, it will enable your application to stay fault-tolerant, following the Elixir principles.

2. **Resources**: There are not many resources online about LLM implementations in the Elixir ecosystem. So, I often found myself needing to understand the basic principles first and then trying to translate a Python implementation.

3. **Inference time**: For some reason, the inference is taking a lot of time to run. I'm still investigating the root cause.

## The implementation

Check out the full implementation [here](https://github.com/jprivillaso/family-tree-agent/blob/main/lib/family_tree_agent/ai/familiy_tree_rag.ex)

As you may have seen above, I mentioned using GenServer and a Supervisor. I took leverage of Elixir's powerful capabilities and implemented a supervisor
to make the application fault tolerant. This way, you can fail gracefully and implement a fallback mechanism. In my case, I'm responding with an error
when a request needs the RAG system and this one is not available yet. That's the beauty of Elixir.

## Summary

Implementing RAG in Elixir proved to be both challenging and rewarding. While Python dominates the ML space with mature libraries, Elixir's Nx and Bumblebee ecosystem provides a solid foundation for building ML applications with the added benefits of fault tolerance and concurrency that the BEAM VM offers.

Key takeaways from this project:

- **Architecture matters**: Decisions about chunking strategy, model selection, and data storage significantly impact the system's effectiveness
- **Elixir viability**: The Elixir ML ecosystem, while younger than Python's, is capable of handling real-world RAG implementations
- **Performance considerations**: Local model inference requires careful memory management and optimization
- **Elixir ecosystem**: Although there are not as many resources in the Elixir ecosystem as in the Python ecosystem, the Elixir ecosystem still proves to be solid and mature enough to allow one to implement a variety of systems, including LLMs.
- **Concept first!**: Understand the concept first, and then it'll be easier to map the steps required to implement a system like this one in Elixir.

To me, the most valuable lesson was that the architectural decisions—how to structure the data, which models to choose, and how to integrate with existing systems—were far more critical than the actual LLM code,  reinforcing my belief that system design knowledge remains a vital human skill, even in an AI-driven world.
